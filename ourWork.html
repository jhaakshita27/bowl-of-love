        <p>Bowl of Love exists to alleviate poverty by enabling the world to give. Bowl of Love
            is the world’s largest humanitarian organization giving food assistance to build a pathway to peace,
            stability and prosperity for people who can't afford it. Our aim is that no person should go to bed with an empty stomach.
            Established in 2022, it is the largest and the most trusted charity and donation platform in India. It enables individuals 
            and organizations to raise and donate funds conveniently to feed the poor and need and help in raising 
            funds for their relief. Bowl of Love's community of 120+ donors and 130+ partners have supported 2,500+ verified nonprofits,
            serving 400+ people across the country.</p>
        <p> BOL holds itself and its staff to the highest standards of integrity and behaviour. We are committed to full
            transparency and accountability to the people we serve and to the donors who generously fund our operations.
            We carry out objective and independent audits, as well as investigations and inspections into suspected
            wrongdoing, misconduct and fraud, as well as sexual exploitation or abuse.
            To ensure that we are fit for purpose, and that we remain so in a constantly and rapidly changing
            environment, we carry out periodic independent evaluations that provide donors and partners with greater
            detail about the effectiveness, efficiency, relevance, impact and sustainability of our work, and that help us to
            continue improving.</p>
